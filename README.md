# Stack Machine VM

A stack based virtual machine and compiler based off of [the instruction set outlined in this book](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/sec3_2.html).


# Rationale and Design Considerations

 * I wanted to write my own FORTH, but didn't want to go through the trouble of learning a real assembly environment.
 * You don't tell me what to do! IM JUST HAVING FUN OK!?

# Road Map

 - [X] Memory.
 - [X] Really basic compiler.
 - [X] Instruction set.
 - [ ] Add support for labels to compiler.
 - [ ] Interupts.
 - [ ] I/O.
 - [ ] FORTH compiler.

# Installation

 1. `npm install`
 2. `typings install`
 3. (Optional) `npm test` to verify installation.

# Usage

TBD

```typescript

// Compilation

// Instantiation

// Run

```

# Instruction Set
